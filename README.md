# DND Equipment Tracker Project

## A tool designed to make tracking items in DND a bit easier for the players

### Description:

This SPA is a great way for newer players to have quick accsess to all the items in D&D 5E. This app
also allows for the players to store the items they need to carry with them in their adventures in a well
organized manner.

### Project Info:

This project uses React.js as a Front-End as well as a seperate json file as a Back-End. The backend for this project which
is needed to have this project work can be found [Here](https://github.com/Kalunodragon/dnd-equipment-backend).

##
### Setup:

#### Back-End:
First you will need to fork and clone the backend for this project. Once again found
[Here](https://github.com/Kalunodragon/dnd-equipment-backend). After this is cloned you can start this server
by moving down into its directory that was just created and running `npm run server`. This should get the
backend of the server fully up and running. You should see a notification in the terminal saying that your
server is running on port 3001 if this has been set up correctly. Keep this up and running!

#### Front-End:
Now for the Front-End, fork and clone this project down to your environment. Once cloned move down into this
new directory and use `npm start` to launch the browser view of the project. If successfully run you should
see in the terminal that there is a localhost now running on port 3000 or your default port to start your applications
on. Also the browser should now open, or open a new tab with the project now running.

Yay! The project has successfully been opened!

### How to use this App:

This app has a home page that will be loaded with a bunch of information on how to fully use the app.
The main way to use this app is to navigate the different tabs and pages of this SPA using the buttons
across the top of the page. The bright red button will be the current page you are on. There should also
be a bit of information on each page letting you know what each page is for. Biggest thing with this app
is to have fun!
